Data Science Projects
* The Projects folder is a sample of some of the projects I have worked on while learning data analysis and data science

* The Notes folder contains notebooks that I compiled as I was studying and following along with tutorials
In the Notes notebooks, you will notice I wrote a lot of notes as I would come across new material.  These notes are for my reference and written in great detail where I felt the need to take extensive notes.  In other places, I may have simply made a short annotation to remind myself as to why a certain line of code was written that way.
